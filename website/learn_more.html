								<p>Ditsa KiranaKart is solving some major problems for the rural retail market and also acting as a platform to generate employment for the rural people. Our startup provides market access; by providing a platform as a marketplace for the manufactured products of DWCRA (Group's Development of Women and Children in Rural Area), we are helping to solve the problem of market access. 
								</br></br>
									Many rural women struggle to get access to markets for their products, which can limit their earning potential and restrict their economic mobility. By providing a platform for them to sell their products, we are helping to connect with a wider market and create new opportunities for economic growth. At heart, we want to solve the problem of unemployment by providing employment opportunities for women within their villages. By creating jobs within the community, we are helping to promote economic development and reduce the need for women to travel long distances to find work. Many rural women lack access to the resources and tools they need to manufacture products and grow crops. 
								</br></br>
									By purchasing their homemade vegetables and other products, you are helping to provide a steady source of income and support their efforts to become more self-sufficient. We are also making it easy for rural shops to buy products from our marketplace. Lack of access to a reliable supply of products is a major issue for most retailers. 
								</br></br>
									Additionally, they also lack storage facilities for the products. By providing an online marketplace, we are giving retailers access to a wider range of products that they may not have been able to source previously. This can help them better meet the needs of their customers and grow their businesses. Also, by addressing the issue of storage facilities, we are helping to reduce waste and improve efficiency in the supply chain. With a reliable and convenient storage option, retailers can order products in larger quantities, reducing the need for frequent restocking trips and improving their bottom line. 
								</br></br>
									We have a good understanding of demand and supply patterns which is critical for any business, as it helps to ensure that the right products are available at the right time and that there is not an excess of inventory that could lead to waste or financial loss. Assisting with logistics is our another key value proposition by which we also add value for retailers, as it can help them save time and money on shipping and handling. 
								</br></br>
									By leveraging our platform's logistics capabilities, retailers may be able to get access to better rates and faster shipping times, which can improve their customer satisfaction and ultimately lead to increased sales. We are working to solve the problem of increasing rural GDP via our marketplace that provides a supply of food products for rural retailers. Agriculture and food production are often key drivers of economic growth in rural areas, and by providing access to a wider range of food products, we are helping to create new business opportunities and jobs in these communities. We hope to find better ways to support economic growth and development in these areas through our platform Ditsa KiranaKart.
